<h2 class="chapter-name" id="mineddaily" class="">How Many Daily Users of Bitcoin?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>
<p>The Bitcoin network processes about 300,000 transactions per day. This number is deceiving, since one transaction can have multiple recipients.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's best to look at the total number of <a href="https://bitcoinvisuals.com/chain-output-count-day">outputs</a> per day. This data shows us that there are between 600,000 - 800,000 people per day, on average, receiving bitcoins on chain (excluding sidechains, Lightning, etc).</p>

<p>But each transaction has a sender, too. Since there are are about 300,000 transactions per day (with one sender) and between 600,000 to 800,000 receivers, there is a maximum of 900,000 to 1.1 million people per day sending or receiving Bitcoin on-chain.</p>

<p>With that said, many of the senders are big exchanges, so the number of senders is likely much lower. Receivers can also receive more than one transaction per day.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Many people use Bitcoin daily by saving. A user who has money parked in Bitcoin us "using" it for investing or saving, but isn't necessarily making transactions every day. This is why we also have to look at the number of bitcoins in wallets.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-name" id="mineddaily" class="">How Many Bitcoin Wallets Are There?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>
<p>Coinbase claims to have more than 30 million accounts, while Blockchain.com claims to have 45 million wallets. With hundreds of other exchanges and wallets, it's likely the total number of Bitcoin wallets is over 100 million.</p>


<h2 class="chapter-name" id="mineddaily" class="">How Many People Know About Bitcoin?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>
<p>About 80% of Americans have heard of Bitcoin, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/survey-japanese-bitcoin/">88%</a> of Japanese and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/93-of-brits-have-heard-of-bitcoin-but-only-4-have-bought-it-survey-shows">93%</a> of Brits.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ing-cryptocurrency-survey/">report</a> puts the number at 66% of Europeans having heard of Bitcoin, with 78% in Poland and 79% in Austria.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/invest-bitcoin-china-survery-40/">China</a>, some 40% of Chinese are interested in investing in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It's quite clear that developed countries' populations are at minimum quite aware of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Based on the numbers above, it would seem there are at least 2 billion people that have heard of Bitcoin. </p>


<h2 class="chapter-name" id="mineddaily" class="">What is Bitcoin's User Growth?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>
<p>This is a hard question to answer. Let's look at some data.</p>
<p>Blockchain.com reported 31,914,414 users on January 1, 2019 and around 45 million on January 1, 2020. This is a 41% increase for the year. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the total number of <a href="https://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/unspent-transaction-output-set?panelId=6&fullscreen&from=1546354940579&to=1577718140579">UTXO's</a> (unspent Bitcoins) grew from 49 million on January 1, 2019 to 65 million a year later. This is an increase of 33%.</p>


<h2 class="chapter-name" id="mineddaily" class="">How Many Users Does Coinbase Have?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/about">Coinbase's website</a> claims that it has served over 30 million users.</p>

<p>This means Coinbase now has <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/coinbase-has-more-users-schwab/">more users</a> than Charles Schwab. </p>

<h2 class="chapter-name" id="mineddaily" class="">What Do People Use Bitcoin For?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>

<h2 class="chapter-name" id="mineddaily" class="">How Many Bitcoin Traders Are There?</h2>
